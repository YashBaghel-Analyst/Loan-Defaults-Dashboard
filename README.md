The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Used to create dynamic visuals, KPIs, and interactive filters.

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated fields, risk segmentation logic, and what-if analysis.

🧹 Power Query – Performed data transformation, type conversion, and cleansing.

🗃️ Microsoft SQL Server – Queried and joined over 200,000 loan records, leveraging views and complex joins.

🔄 DirectQuery Mode – Ensured near real-time analytics with incremental refresh capabilities.

📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for report previews.
